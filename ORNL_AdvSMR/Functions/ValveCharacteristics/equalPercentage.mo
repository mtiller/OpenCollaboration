  annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
This characteristic is such that the relative change of the flow coefficient is proportional to the change in the stem position:
<p> d(rc)/d(pos) = k d(pos).
<p> The constant k is expressed in terms of the rangeability, i.e. the ratio between the maximum and the minimum useful flow coefficient:
<p> rangeability = exp(k) = rc(1.0)/rc(0.0).
<p> The theoretical characteristic has a non-zero opening when pos = 0; the implemented characteristic is modified so that the valve closes linearly when pos &lt delta.
